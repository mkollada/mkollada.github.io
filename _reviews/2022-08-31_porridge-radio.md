On Water Slide, Diving Board, Ladder To The Sky, the British rock band, Porridge Radio, puts on an epic performance. Expressing exhaustion, exasperation, and doubt, this record acts as a cathartic release. The tracks often start soft and build into soaring, irresistible anthems. The lyrics stray away from specifics, with Dana Margolin’s powerful vocals bringing them to life. She's at times forceful, almost growling, at others tender and pensive. On “U Can Be Happy If You Want To” she sings “It comes in waves / I peel off my skin,” and the pace of the album, the catharsis, follows suit. Each climax gives way for moments of calm and rest, shedding unneeded weight before the next peak rises up. This album was a great ride that had me singing at the top of my lungs into the steering wheel down I-90.
