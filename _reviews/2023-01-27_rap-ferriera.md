In “5 to the Eye with Stars”, R.A.P. (Rory Allen Phillip) Ferreira channels both the philosopher and the poet, making magic at the intersection of the abstract and the concrete. In the middle of “mythesizer instinct” he drops this gem: “ I simply stay in tune, my thoughts a walking bassline / There are days I only get to see my son on Facetime / Man-made monsoon, RollerCoaster Tycoon / I believe I'll dust my broom as the blues echo through my being.” He rhythmically bobs and weaves throughout, always a step ahead, continuously delighting with his syllables, word-play, and cadence. On the opening track Ferreira finishes repeating “I know its epic poetry that keeps the cosmos orbiting”. The line says out loud what the whole project puts on display, that the right words, the “epic poetry” that is great rap, has the power to shape our thinking and thus our world.
