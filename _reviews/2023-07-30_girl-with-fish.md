I was hooked on Feeble Little House when the intro track on their debut album “Hayday” - beautiful, softly sung, only backed with fingerpicked guitar - smashed right into a wall of distorted sounds and chaotic energy on track two. It was perfect, no notes.

Now on their second album, “Girl with Fish”, they’re back with their unique combination of playful sarcasm, catchiness, and punchy noise-rock instrumentation. They play these off each other powerfully - the melodies and repetition of lead singer, Lydia Slocum, give us something to hold on to amid the tension of their sound and the narrative of turbulent romance. Slocum herself puts on an unbothered air. Her dry delivery tries to convince us she’s can't be shook. Then, when the weight is too much, whether for a moment or a few songs, her armor cracks, revealing the hurt and insecurities it had been protecting - “How can you be satisfied / she’s 5 foot 1 and you’re 6 foot 5,” she sings on “Freak” her voice screeching upward on the word five. It’s in these moments where the album really shines for me, the honesty bringing catharsis that is deeply felt in the music.
