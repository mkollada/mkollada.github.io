A listen to any track on billy woods’ “Maps” immediately reveals him as prolific - it feels unbelievable what he packs into a few lines. Slant rhymes and clever wordplay fly out relentlessly, as profound thoughts combining the philosophical and personal are all of a sudden stacked next to gems like a mouth-watering recipe for pork belly (listen to “Blue Smoke” and tell me it doesn’t sound fire). All of his brilliance is laid over, jerky, static-laden beats from frequent collaborator, Kenny Segal. The production expertly creates an atmosphere, primes the listener, and then gets out of the way to let woods shine. Released in May, this project sees the rapper on the move, examining the moments, the people, the contradictions he comes across on tour. On it, no one’s safe from woods’ piercing gaze, that includes himself, and certainly includes his rich neighbors having him over for dinner and natural wine. woods is a master of looking hard realities square in the eye. “People don't want the truth, they want me to tell 'em grandma went to heaven” he declares on “Babylon by Bus”. This bluntness, combined with his otherworldly talent as a wordsmith, makes “Maps” a thrilling listen.
