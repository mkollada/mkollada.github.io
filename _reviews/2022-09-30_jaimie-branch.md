By all accounts, jaimie branch was a force to be reckoned with. Sadly, this past month the prolific trumpeter, composer, and producer passed away at the age of 39. It was in the ensuing outpouring of sadness, disbelief, and celebration of her life that I learned of her music. Tributes to her life show branch to be revered by those who knew her, both as a musician and a person, for the ferocity, conviction, and joy that she wore on her sleeve. Listening to her play trumpet, especially on live recordings, these characteristics are palpable. Having trained at the New England Conservatory, she has a fascinating set of technical abilities, but it’s clear those chops are there to serve at the whim of what she aims to express. Whether she’s playing slow and contemplative, or fast and chaotic, her horn lines are filled with life. This coupled with intricate, at times catchy, rhythm section (she composes alongside her trumpet playing) made her music surprisingly easy to approach for me, as someone who doesn’t listen to a ton of contemporary jazz records. All of this creates truly unique and inspiring music. I recommend anyone, including people who don’t typically like jazz, listen to her music. Her sound is that powerful.
