Pip millet starts off her lovely debut album posing the question again and again: “So you think you know me?” before ending the intro with the proclamation “you don’t know a thing about me… and you’ll never be close.” By the end of the album, one thing I do know about Pip is that she’s earned her spot amongst the new-age R&amp;B / neo-soul titans (the Jorja Smith and SZA’s) of the world. Throughout the project, her feathery voice takes center stage floating over mostly subdued hip hop beats with a surprise dance track, Slow, reminiscent of Jamila Woods’ BETTY (for Boogie). When Everything is Better, I’ll Let You Know is an album that can be easily enjoyed with a casual play and heavily appreciated upon a deeper listen. 

Highlights: Slow, Smoking
