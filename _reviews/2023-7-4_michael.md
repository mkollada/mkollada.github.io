Durand Jones’s solo debut, which explores his southern roots in the town of Hilaryville Louisiana, is as personal as it is beautiful. Whether soundtracked to the vocal choirs and organs of a southern Baptist church (Wait til I get Over, I Want You) or memphis blues (Sadie, Lord have Mercy) every song crescendos with Durand Jones’s raspy belting. However, the album’s peaks are found in the tender moments that serve as the best compliment to Durand’s powerful voice: the soft piano intros and outros of Secrets/ Gerry Marie or the layered string arrangements of That Feeling (also Gerry Marie). All in all, Durand Jones has crafted a beautiful piece of work, which following Aaron Frazer’s sublime solo debut, has left me craving a new Durand Jones and the Indications album as both artists continue to create at the peak of their powers. So why should you give this record a listen? Because Wait til I get over is the album you’d most want to hear.
