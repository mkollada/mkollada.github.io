The playfully, or egregiously (depending on the level of whimsy you’ll allow), titled Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You, is an expansive, exploratory record, that see's Big Thief trying out a wide range of sounds. Big rock songs, hoe-downs, a genre I’ve seen called “trip-hop”, and my personal weakness, lead singer Adrianne Lenker-led ballads. It's long, but DNWMIBIY has felt more to me like a fantastic collection to be perused at your own pace, than a singular masterpiece that you have to listen to straight through. The thread running through this album, and all the band’s music, is a captivating rawness. Whether its existential silliness (Spud Infinity), melancholic longing (12,000 Lines), or giddy love (Little Things), their songs are saturated in unapologetic emotion. I like them a lot, and hope you to do. Give this one a spin and let me know if my use of “existential silliness” is justified, overly indulgent, or like the album’s title, both.
