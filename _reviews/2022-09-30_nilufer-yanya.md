Nilüfer Yanya’s voice is fascinating. Its chilly depth and fullness doesn’t need to strain to be powerful. The London born artist’s delivery can be incredibly varied, switching between smooth falsetto, cool spoken word, and snappy vocal inflections without losing an ounce of effectiveness. This allows her an ease, a sense of control that makes her performances captivating, as she matches the shifting atmospheres that the band around her creates. Luscious guitar rhythms and smooth horns are familiar figures in music that is centered around rock, but never quite fits comfortably in that mold. I simply can't get enough of the song "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3zbvtH7AZF6pldwSvpdJtV">Melt</a>" off of her 2019 album, Miss Universe - the lines "I bet your brain cells won't last / I bet they cling to the trash" have been stuck in my head for about a month. Nilufer’s sound is completely singular and I'm excited to watch it continue to develop over the coming years.
