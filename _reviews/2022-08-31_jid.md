A lot of people, me included, have been waiting on this one for a while. East Atlanta rapper, JID, first hinted about this project back in 2019. Luckily he hasn’t been quiet in the meantime. He’s highlighted collective albums by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2n3quCZ0anEa46j2IveacI?si=cDlJy1LuRn2bqzvnvL1WQg" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">J. Cole’s Dreamville label</a>, as well as his own group, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2L13Kv0sx6GPAHo7QTZLAy?si=pWSt9QUoQzacBZVwcMtx3g" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Spillage Village</a>, and has been generally out-rapping your favorite rapper on their own songs. Still, with his hype steadily building, this release felt big. On “The Forever Story,” JID delivers. His prolific talent colors a mural of all that he’s been through. JID raps about significant moments in his years before success, the roots of his work ethic, and the distance fame has brought between him and things he cares about. Throughout, his fascinating flows and rhyme patterns are clever enough to make you feel accomplished through osmosis. On “Better Days” JID raps “To make it to forever took a very long time.” I'm one of many who's glad he got here.
