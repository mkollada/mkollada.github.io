Fresh off the heels of four excellent albums co-starring with El P as the Run the Jewels duo, “Michael” somehow feels like an even bigger accomplishment for the rapper Killer Mike. Production-wise, picture the late-60’s-era backing band at Stax Records (probably Booker T and the MGs) driving down from Memphis to Atlanta and setting up shop in the church where the region’s best southern Baptist choir holds residence. And at the pulpit is Killer Mike, the in-your-face, grizzled, charismatic reverend. But he’s not interested in pushing religious dogma or a political narrative. Instead, he digs deep with every ounce of his soul to speak the messy truth (semi-autobiographically) of what it means to come of age as a Black man in Atlanta. I hesitate to use the term “instant classic” for any recently released album, but would not be surprised in a few years to hear “Michael” mentioned in the same breath as Jay-Z’s “Blueprint” or Chance’s “Coloring Book”. It is a statement record for Killer Mike and essential listening in 2023.
