This album is such a feel good listen. Jake Xerxes Fussell was a tiny desk find, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB6jTKPOjMY">that concert</a> is a great place to start with his music. Good and Green Again is full of folksy ballads that are anchored by sweet vocal and guitar melodies. Each song is its own quaint vignette, where more than tell a story, he creates a folk-tale-like atmosphere. The result is a beautiful, peaceful album that moves at its own pace. It encourages us to revel in the serene moments it creates. Put this on, close your eyes, 40 minutes will breeze by, and at the end you just might feel a little lighter.
