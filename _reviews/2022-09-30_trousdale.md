I was lucky enough to spend my weekend at the Sound on Sound music festival, and with The Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll headline, I didn’t expect a never-before heard, pop-folk group to be the highlight. But they were. Trousdale (“troooz-dale”), is an LA-based, self-produced group of three B-A-Bs. Their lyrics hit on the fragility of love, the desire to be heard, the fear of words and their many interpretations, and the sometimes unfortunate realization that growth and loss are deeply intertwined. They speak to the struggles of finding connection, but they offer hope through their breathtaking sound - only made possible with their three-way chemistry (they’ve described it as a sort of “magic [they] feel with one another”.) Their harmonies engulf the listener with a gentle empathy, acknowledging the difficulties of being “closer to who we are”; but their crescendos challenge us by reminding us that vulnerability is the root to overwhelming beauty and the pinnacle of connection. The trio invites us to dig through the dirt - to listen to the “color of [each other’s] voices” and to “live every moment to live” - all while sounding angelic and looking like badass queens. They’re deep, they’re hot, and they’re about to be big.
