Throughout "Remember Your North Star",  Yaya Bey switches genres and delivery styles consistently. "big daddy ya" is powerful, grooving track with flows that remind me of early 00's R&amp;B. On "reprise", one of my favorite songs of the year so far, Yaya raps with a knowing, measured pace over slow, jazzy horns. "meet me in brooklyn" and "it was just a dance" lean heavily into reggae sounds. Working through the trauma of having her mother in and out of her life, struggling to find love she can count on and more, she puts on display a kaleidoscope of states, perspectives, and emotions. What results is a picture of her experience painted with striking depth. A front to back listen blew me away.
