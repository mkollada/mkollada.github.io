Introducing their self-titled album on Instagram, the band's lead singer, Emily Sprague, tells us "Florist" was recorded inside a screened-in porch in the Hudson Valley of New York. Throughout the album, it sounds and feels like you’re there with them, settling into the peace of the woods. The breeze mentioned in one song can be heard blowing the bells and chimes in later interludes. Crickets and raindrops fill space left by lightly picked guitars. The group feels unhurried, enjoying their own unique combination of nature, music, and people. On top of it all are Sprague's patient, tender melodies. It seems like she can say anything she needs to in plain terms, about connections to people close to her, about the environment surrounding her, about how she feels right now. It’s a piece of music that feels strikingly present. I highly recommend it for a quiet night in or evening walk through the park.
