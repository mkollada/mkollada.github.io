What's up good people,
<br>
<br>
Excited to get back to sharing some music with y'all after a bit of a hiatus. The break was not all for naught though, in the meantime I put together a website for The Collective Record. You can find it here: www.thecollectiverecord.com. 
<br>
As with the newsletters, I hope the site is a place where people I love can find and share music they love. Right now, all of the collective playlists, featured albums, and full newsletters can be found there. Share it with anyone who might want some new music in their life - they can sign up to receive future newsletters there too. I'm dreaming up some fun updates for it, so stayed tuned for more.

We've got a great shared playlist started for edition #6. Check it out, and add song or two for the rest of us:

A couple TCR regulars have dropped in, as Zack, Ryan, and I recommend a few albums below.
