	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">I listened to the first episode of the Radiolab series "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/67Neaj85KIVfEpaXqFG2yL" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #007C89;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Mixtape</a>", recommended by Friend-of-the-Newsletter MJ Brown. The first episode follows the story of western music reaching China in the late 90s via mass dumps of cassettes that were supposed to be recycled. It was a fascinating look at how context, or lack thereof in this case, impacts how we hear music.</li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">I recently found out that Bob Dylan did a radio series from 2006 to 2009 called "<a href="http://www.themetimeradio.com/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #007C89;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Theme Time Radio</a>". On each episode he curates a set of songs around a theme like Mothers or Weather. Its archival in a way I really enjoy, and acts as a nice curveball from music I normally listen to.</li>
